# Dice-Roll-Bot
My first attempt at a bot I made, even though I watched a tutorial on it. all using python 3.11 with pycharm
you will need to run this on pycharm to get it to work properly, It's only a bare basic bot with one command.
I did follow a youtube video on what to do and put but i did enjoy my experience putting in the code.
Feel free to use it and ad anything you wish, No Licence needed.
